Quick Guidance 
---
When you are authoring your Markdown content in CAPS, you could get help from different ways:
- Use `Alt + F1` in IE or `F1` in Chrome to open `Command Palette`
- Use `Ctrl + space` at any place to open insert.
- Use authoring tool bar on the top of the editor to help create your content

Format your content
---
- **Paragraph**
  Paragraphs in Markdown are just one or more lines of consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines.
  
  ```
  On July 2, an alien ship entered Earth's orbit and deployed several dozen saucer-shaped "destroyer" spacecraft, each 15 miles (24 km) wide.
  
  On July 3, the Black Knights, a squadron of Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets, participated 
  ```
  
- **Headings**  
  You can either you header dropdown list provided in the authoring toolbar, or manually add '---' or '===' in the     next line under your section title. You can also create a heading by adding one or more `#` symbols before your     heading text. The number of `#` you use will determine the size of the heading.

  ```
  # The largest heading (an <h1> tag)
  ## The second largest heading (an <h2> tag)
  â€¦
  ###### The 6th largest heading (an <h6> tag)
  ```

- **Block quotes**
  You can indicate block quotes with a `>`.
  ```
  In the words of Abraham Lincoln:
  
  > Pardon my French
  > Second line of the quote
  ```

- **Styling text**
  You can make your text **Bold** or *italic*
  ```
  **This text will be bold**
  *This text will be italic*  
  ```
  You can also use authoring toolbar to achieve this

- **Lists**
  You can add an unordered list by preceding list items with `*` or `-`
  ```
  * Item
  * Item
  * Item
  
  - Item
  - Item
  - Item  
  ```
  You can add ordered list by preceding list items with a number
  ```
  1. Item 1
  2. Item 2
  3. Item 3  
  ```
  You can create nested lists by indenting list items by two spaces.
  ```
  1. Item 1
    1. A corollary to the above item.
    2. Yet another point to consider.
  2. Item 2
    * A corollary that does not need to be ordered.
      * This is indented four spaces, because it's two spaces further than the item above.
      * You might want to consider making a new list.
  3. Item 3 
  ```
  You can also use authoring toolbar to achieve this
  
- **Code formatting**
  You can use triple ticks (```) to format text as its own distinct block.
  Check out this neat program I wrote:  
  ~~~~
  ```
  x = 0
  x = 2 + 2
  what is x
  ```
  ~~~~

Add Reference to your content
---
- **Insert Links**
  You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets `[Link Label]`, and then wrapping the link in    parentheses `(http://URL)`. 
  [Bing.com](http://www.bing.com)
  
  You can also create a link to an existing topic in CAPS with the authoring toolbar
  
- **Insert Image**
  You can reference a online image from external resource by using `![Image Label]`, and then wrapping the image resource url in parentheses `(http://ImageURL)`
  
  You can also insert an image from CAPS with the authoring toolbar


<br/>
Using tables in your content
---
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

You can also include inline Markdown format syntax such as links, bold, italics, or strike through:

| Name | Description          |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Help      | ~~Display the~~ help window.|
| Close     | _Closes_ a window     |

You can have more formatting control by including colons : within the header row, you can define text to be left-aligned, right-aligned, or center-aligned:

| Left-Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | some wordy text | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat        |    $1 |

A colon on the **left-most** side indicates a left-aligned column; a colon on the **right-most** side indicates a right-aligned column; a colon on **both** sides indicates a center-aligned column.
